## About

Run connect_four.rb to play. Each input (e.g. row number and column number) is taken separately. Connect Four rules (including "gravity" - i.e. pieces must be "stacked" to reach higher rows) apply. The rows and columns are numbered in the terminal, and pieces are labeled "Y" and "R" to represent the traditional colors. First player is selected at random.
